This is a simple fork of SSL Requirement to allow you to redirect 
to the specific host whose DNS name matches common name (CN) on
the X.509 cert.  This prevents unnecessary error dialogs.

To use it, you merely override the template method 'ssl_cn_host', 
which returns the request host, by default.
